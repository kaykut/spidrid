What if you could read twice as fast — and still remember everything? What if you could turn your commute doomscroll into a curiosity feast?

Devoro uses RSVP technology to show words exactly where your eye focuses, removing the back-and-forth scanning that slows traditional reading. It feels strange for about 30 seconds. Then it clicks.

READ
Bring your own content. Paste any URL, upload a PDF or EPUB, or drop in plain text. Devoro serves it back at whatever pace feels right — from a comfortable 200 WPM to a blazing 1500.

LEARN
Type any topic you're curious about — philosophy, nutrition, how satellites work — and Devoro generates articles just for you. Every article ends with a quiz to lock in what you learned and gauge your understanding to adjust your pace.
